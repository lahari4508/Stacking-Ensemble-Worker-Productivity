# Stacking-Ensemble-Worker-Productivity
A machine learning project to predict worker productivity using ensemble models

# Worker Productivity Prediction using Stacking Ensemble ML

## 📌 Problem Statement
In the apparel industry, worker productivity plays a crucial role in meeting production targets.
Traditional evaluation methods are manual, time-consuming, and often inaccurate.
Hence, an automated and data-driven system is required to predict worker productivity efficiently.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project proposes a **Stacking Ensemble Machine Learning Model** to predict
garment worker productivity more accurately by combining multiple regression models.
The ensemble approach reduces individual model bias and improves overall prediction performance.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- **Stacking Ensemble (Meta-model: Linear Regression)**  

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset: Garment Worker Productivity Dataset  
- Source: Kaggle  
- Rows: 1,197  
- Features: 15 (Targeted productivity, incentives, team size, SMV, overtime, etc.)

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data collection from Kaggle  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
3. Feature selection and engineering  
4. Training individual regression models  
5. Applying stacking ensemble technique  
6. Model evaluation using multiple metrics  

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  

## 🏆 Results
The stacking ensemble model outperformed individual models by achieving:
- Lower MAE, MSE, and RMSE  
- Higher R² score  
This demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning in productivity prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Machine Learning  

## 🎯 Applications
- Apparel manufacturing productivity monitoring  
- Workforce performance analysis  
- Decision support for production managers
